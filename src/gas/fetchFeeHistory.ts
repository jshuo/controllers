 * @param args.endBlock - The desired end of the block range. Can be a block tag ("latest" for the
 * latest successful block or "pending" for the latest pending block) or a block id.
 * @param args.numberOfBlocks - How many blocks to include in the block range (starting from
 * `endBlock` and working backward). Each type of data in the return value will have this many items
 * in it.
 * @param args.percentiles - A set of numbers between 1 and 100 which will advise how
 * priorityFeesByPercentile in the return value will be formed. When Ethereum runs the
 * `eth_feeHistory` method, for each block it is considering, it will first sort all transactions by
 * the priority fee. It will then go through each transaction and add the total amount of gas paid
 * for that transaction to a bucket which maxes out at the total gas used for the whole block. As
 * the bucket fills, it will cross percentages which correspond to the percentiles specified here,
 * and the priority fees of the transactions which cause it to reach those percentages will be
 * recorded. Hence, priorityFeesByPercentile represents the priority fees of transactions at key gas
 * used contribution levels, where earlier contributions have smaller fees and later contributions
 * have higher fees.
 * @returns The fee history data.
